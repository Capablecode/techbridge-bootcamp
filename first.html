        My name is <b>Alabi Sunday,</b> and I am an aspiring and intermediate
        frontend developer and a Computer Science graduate. From a young age,
        Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our world.
        This curiosity eventually led me to discover the world of web
        development, particularly frontend development, which combines my love
        for creativity with my technical skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <em>frontend web developer</em>, I am passionate about creating
        visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.I enjoy working with
        <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,</b> and I am constantly exploring new
        frameworks and libraries, such as React. The ability to transform ideas
        into interactive web applications excites me, and I thrive on the
        challenge of problem-solving that comes with coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just started a scholarship frontend web development program with
        <b>NerdzFactory</b>, The Tech Bridge Program under the
        <b>IDEAS Project</b>. I am so happy to learn, grow and improve my tech
        skills.
